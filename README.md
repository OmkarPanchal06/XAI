# XAI
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to a set of techniques and methods that make the decisions and predictions of AI models transparent, understandable, and interpretable to humans.

->Instead of acting like a “black box,” XAI helps users understand:

1. Why a model made a particular decision
2. Which features influenced the output
3. How the model behaves in different situations
